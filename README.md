Perfect — based on **your hackathon problem statement, Excalidraw UI planning, and feature PDFs**, below is a **single, complete, production-ready `README.md / PROJECT.md` style document**.


# Dayflow – Human Resource Management System (HRMS)

> **Every workday, perfectly aligned.**

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Dayflow** is a role-based Human Resource Management System (HRMS) designed to digitize and streamline core HR operations such as employee onboarding, authentication, attendance tracking, leave (time-off) management, employee profile management, and salary visibility.

The system is built with a **clear separation between Admin and Employee roles**, ensuring security, data privacy, and real-world HR workflow simulation.

This project is developed as a **hackathon-ready working MVP**, with scope for future enterprise-level extensions.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Most small to mid-scale organizations still rely on:

* Manual attendance tracking
* Email / WhatsApp based leave approvals
* Scattered employee data
* Poor visibility into employee work status

This results in:

* Data inconsistency
* Human errors
* Lack of transparency
* Poor HR decision-making

**Dayflow solves this by providing a centralized, role-based HRMS platform.**
